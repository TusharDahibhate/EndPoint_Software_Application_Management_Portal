# Endpoint Software/Application Management Portal

This project served as the final year project for the partial fulfilment of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from 
Singhad College of Engineering(Pune University). This project was completed by a team of 4 under the guidance of Prof. A.R. Joshi along 
with seasoned mentors from the industry.

The repository contains the resources relevant to the project.

## Description
The installation of any software requires prior knowledge of the software dependencies which only a person with some technical background 
will have. The installation process could be tedious and time consuming at times. This project will manage software and applications on 
any endpoint. It will be used to automate the process of software installation to reduce the manual efforts required during installation 
of a software. It will also be used to provide application execution environments.
